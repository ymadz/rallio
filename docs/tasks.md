- Update this file as you complete tasks

## Technical Debt & Code Quality Issues

### 🔴 Must Fix Before Production
- [ ] **Add test infrastructure** - Zero tests exist (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] **Create logger utility** - 100+ console.log statements in production code:
  - `web/src/app/actions/payments.ts` (~25 logs)
  - `web/src/app/actions/queue-actions.ts`
  - `web/src/app/api/webhooks/paymongo/route.ts` (~30 logs)
  - `web/src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`
  - `web/src/hooks/use-queue.ts`
- [ ] **Fix role assignment duplicate error** - Auth callback logs `23505` error
- [ ] **Fix CSS linting** - `@theme` at-rule warning in `globals.css` (Tailwind v4)

### 🟡 Should Fix Soon
- [ ] **Consolidate Supabase service clients** - Duplicate definitions in:
  - `web/src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (line 27)
  - `web/src/lib/supabase/service.ts` (entire file - DELETE)
- [ ] **Remove unused TanStack Query** - Listed in package.json but never imported
- [ ] **Add Redis rate limiting** - Current in-memory store won't scale multi-server
- [ ] **Align React versions** - web uses 18.3.1, root overrides to 19.1.0
- [ ] **Review `force-dynamic` usage** - Home page disables all caching unnecessarily

### 🟢 Nice to Have
- [ ] Add Zod validation to ALL server action inputs (some missing)
- [ ] Implement React Query for venue/court caching
- [ ] Add error boundary components throughout app
- [ ] Improve loading/empty states consistency
- [ ] Update README.md (says Next.js 14, actually 15)
